# Chef's kiss 🤌🏽

A self-hosted digital cookbook of sorts, because 99% of recipe websites suck.

## TODO

-   Just generally make the app usable
-   Recipe CRUD
-   Dark mode
-   Adapt for mobile
-   Scraper to make it easier to port recipes over from crappy adware sites.
-   Some kind of cool display for recipes/ingredients that might help ✨inspire✨
-   Export (e.g. to PDF)
-   Since ingredients and quantities will be tracked, a way to visualise this data might be cool.
